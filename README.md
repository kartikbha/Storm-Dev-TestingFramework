# Storm-Dev-TestingFramework

This very simple storm Dev and Testing framework which can really boost the development process without need to write full topology code.
I am using below libraries in this project. This Dev framwork can mimic storm running behaviour and can also mimic tuple style data types inputs..

 - jeromq-0.3.4.jar
 - jackson-annotations-2.1.2.jar
 - com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jar
 - com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jar
 - 
 
Once development work is over in these template, you can move to real topology for integration testing.
